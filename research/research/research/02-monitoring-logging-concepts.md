# Monitoring & Logging Concepts

## Monitoring

Monitoring is the process of continuously observing the state of system
components such as services, processes, and resources. Its primary goal is to
ensure system availability, performance, and reliability.

At the operating system level, monitoring focuses on:
- Service status (active / inactive)
- Process execution
- System resource usage

Monitoring allows system administrators and DevOps teams to detect failures
early and take corrective actions before they impact users.

## Logging

Logging refers to the collection and storage of system-generated messages that
describe events occurring within the operating system. These messages may
include informational events, warnings, and errors.

Logs are essential for:
- Troubleshooting system issues
- Auditing system activity
- Detecting security incidents
- Supporting forensic investigations

In this project, logging mechanisms are used to analyze warning and error logs
generated by the operating system.

## Relationship Between Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring and logging are closely related but serve different purposes.
Monitoring focuses on the current state of the system, while logging provides
historical records of system behavior.

Together, they form the foundation of operational visibility in modern
DevOps and SecOps environments.
