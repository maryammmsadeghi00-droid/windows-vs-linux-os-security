# Introduction

Monitoring and logging are fundamental components of modern operating systems.
They enable system administrators, DevOps engineers, and security teams to
observe system behavior, detect failures, and respond to incidents in a timely
manner.

In open source and proprietary operating systems, monitoring mechanisms are
responsible for tracking the status of system services, processes, and system
resources. Logging mechanisms, on the other hand, record system events,
warnings, and errors that are essential for troubleshooting, auditing, and
security analysis.

With the growth of DevOps practices, monitoring has become a key factor in
ensuring service availability, performance, and reliability. Similarly, in
SecOps environments, logs play a critical role in detecting security incidents,
identifying anomalies, and supporting forensic investigations.

This project focuses on operating system–level monitoring and logging by
implementing simple, practical scripts for both Windows and Linux operating
systems. The research section provides the theoretical background that supports
the practical implementation included in this repository.
