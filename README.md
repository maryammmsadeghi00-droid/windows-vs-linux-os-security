# Monitoring & Logging in Operating Systems  
## Open Source OS – DevOps – SecOps

This repository contains simple and practical scripts designed to monitor **system services** and analyze **system logs** in operating systems, with a focus on **Monitoring & Logging concepts** used in **DevOps** and **SecOps** environments.

The project demonstrates how operating system–level monitoring helps improve system reliability, detect failures, and support security operations.
